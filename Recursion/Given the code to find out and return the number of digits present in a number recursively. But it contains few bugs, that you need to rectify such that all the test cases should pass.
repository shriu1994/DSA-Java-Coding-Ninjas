Given the code to find out and return the number of digits present in a number recursively. But it contains few bugs, that you need to rectify such that all the test cases should pass.

public class Solution {

	public static int count(int n){
		//Write your code here
          if (n==0){
            return 0;
        }
        int output = 1+ count(n/10);
        return output;
    }

}

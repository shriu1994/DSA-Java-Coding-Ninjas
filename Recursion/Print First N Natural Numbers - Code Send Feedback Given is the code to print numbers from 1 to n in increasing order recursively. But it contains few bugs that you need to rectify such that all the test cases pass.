Given is the code to print numbers from 1 to n in increasing order recursively. But it contains few bugs that you need to rectify such that all the test cases pass.

public class Solution {

	public static void print(int n){
        if(n==0){
            return;
        }
        print(n-1);
        System.out.print(n+" ");
    }
		//Write your code here

}

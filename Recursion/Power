Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.

public class Solution {

	public static int power(int x, int n) {
        if(n==0) {
			return 1;
		}
		return x * power(x,n-1);
		
		
	
        if(n==0){
            return 1;
        }
        int smallOutput = power(x,n-1);
        int output = n*smallOutput;
        return output;
        
		/* Your class should be named Solution
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
		 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
		 */
		
	}
}

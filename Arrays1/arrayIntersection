You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

package Lec7operators_loops;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class arrayIntersection {
	public static void intersections(int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
        //Your code goes here

        int n1=arr1.length;
        int n2=arr2.length;



        for(int i = 0;i<n1;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<n2;j++)
            {
                if(arr1[i]==arr2[j])
                {
                    System.out.print(arr1[i]+" ");
                    arr2[j]=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        int arr1[] = {2,6,1,2};
        int arr2[] = {1,2,3,4,2};
        intersections(arr1,arr2); // output 2 1 2
    }
